# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using **Factory Functions** and the **Module Pattern** in JavaScript. It implements the game logic using separate modules, making the code modular and easy to maintain.

## Gameplay

To play the Tic Tac Toe game, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You will see a 3x3 grid representing the Tic Tac Toe board with empty cells.

- The game starts with **Player X's** turn.
- Click on an empty cell to place an **X** or an **O**, depending on the current player's turn.
- The game alternates between **Player X** and **Player O** after each move.
- The first player to get three of their marks (X or O) in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.
